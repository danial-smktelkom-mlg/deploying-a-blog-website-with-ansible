### **Step 1: Preparing Your Environment**

#### **Exercise 1.1: Creating the Inventory File**

Create an inventory file named `inventory.ini` with the following content:
```ini
[blog]
your_host_ip ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/private/key.pem
```
- **Objective**: Define the serverâ€™s IP, host user, and SSH key.
- **Additional Exercise**: Modify the file to connect to a different server, if available.

#### **Exercise 1.2: Testing Ansible Connectivity**

Verify the Ansible connection using the command:
```bash
ansible -i inventory.ini blog -m ping
```
- **Objective**: Ensure Ansible can connect to the server.
- **Additional Exercise**: Use a different inventory or modify the connection parameters.

### **Step 2: Creating the Playbook**

#### **Exercise 2.1: Basic Playbook Setup**

Create a playbook named `playbook.yml`:
```yaml
- hosts: blog
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update package repository
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
```
- **Objective**: Start by updating the package repository.
- **Additional Exercise**: Add a task to install a simple package like `curl`.

#### **Exercise 2.2: Installing Required Packages**

Extend the playbook to install Apache, MariaDB, and PHP:
```yaml
    - name: Install Apache, MariaDB, and PHP
      apt:
        name:
          - apache2
          - mariadb-server
          - php
          - php-mysqli
          - php-mbstring
        state: present
```
- **Objective**: Automate the installation of the necessary packages.
- **Additional Exercise**: Verify the installations by checking the versions of each package.

#### **Exercise 2.3: Install Python Dependencies for MySQL**

Add a task to install Python MySQL dependencies:
```yaml
    - name: Install Python MySQL dependencies
      apt:
        name: python3-pymysql
        state: present
```
- **Objective**: Ensure MySQL management modules work in Ansible.
- **Additional Exercise**: Verify by running `pip show pymysql`.

---

### **Step 3: Managing MySQL**

#### **Exercise 3.1: Create MySQL Database and User**

Add tasks to create the MySQL database and user:
```yaml
    - name: Create MySQL admin user
      mysql_user:
        name: blog2
        password: blog2
        priv: "*.*:ALL,GRANT"
        host: "%"
        state: present
        login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

    - name: Create Blog database
      mysql_db:
        name: blog2
        state: present
        login_user: blog2
        login_password: blog2
```
- **Objective**: Automate the creation of the database and user for the blog.
- **Additional Exercise**: Verify by logging into MySQL and checking the created database and user.

### **Step 4: Deploying the Website**

#### **Exercise 4.1: Cloning the GitHub Repository**

Add a task to clone the blog repository from GitHub:
```yaml
    - name: Clone blog repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/danial-smktelkom-mlg/blog2.git
        dest: /var/www/html/blog2
```
- **Objective**: Automate the cloning of the blog repository to the server.
- **Additional Exercise**: Verify by checking if the files exist in `/var/www/html/blog2`.

#### **Exercise 4.2: Importing SQL File into Database**

Add a task to import the `db.sql` file into the `blog2` database:
```yaml
    - name: Import SQL file into database
      mysql_db:
        name: blog2
        state: import
        target: /var/www/html/blog2/db.sql
        login_user: blog2
        login_password: blog2
```
- **Objective**: Automate the import of the SQL file into the database.
- **Additional Exercise**: Verify by checking the contents of the `blog2` database.

#### **Exercise 4.3: Configure Apache for the Blog**

##### **Exercise 4.3.1: Update Apache VirtualHost**

Use the `replace` module to update the Apache VirtualHost configuration:
```yaml
    - name: Update Apache VirtualHost for blog
      replace:
        path: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
        regexp: 'DocumentRoot /var/www/html'
        replace: 'DocumentRoot /var/www/html/blog2'
```
- **Objective**: Automate Apache VirtualHost configuration for the blog.
- **Additional Exercise**: Open the server IP in a browser to verify that the blog is accessible.

##### **Exercise 4.3.2: Enable Site Configuration and Restart Apache**

Add tasks to enable the new site configuration and restart Apache:
```yaml
    - name: Enable the new site configuration
      command: a2ensite 000-default.conf

    - name: Restart Apache to apply changes
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```
- **Objective**: Ensure the new site configuration is enabled and Apache is restarted for changes to take effect.
- **Additional Exercise**: Check the Apache error log if the blog does not display correctly.

---

### **Final Practice: Full Playbook Execution**

To execute the full automation, combine all tasks and run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
- **Objective**: Automate the complete blog installation and configuration process.
- **Observation**: After running the playbook, the blog should be fully deployed and accessible.
